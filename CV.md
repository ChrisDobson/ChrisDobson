Personal Statement

Last year, I decided to reskill as a Software Developer in JavaScript. Following the completion of my Northcoders Bootcamp in January 2025, I am now looking for an entry level position in the technology sector. I find programming extremely enjoyable, because it excites me, it challenges me and it encourages me to learn new things and interact with a global community of like-minded coders.

Technical Skills

    • Languages: JavaScript, using Node.js and browsers as environment
    • Testing: TDD (Test Driven Development), Jest, Supertest
    • Back-end: SQL, PSQL, seeding, migrations
    • Front-end: HTML, CSS, React, Lighthouse and other accessibility tools
    • Hosting: Cloudflare, Netlify
    • Other: Paired programming, technical communication, SDL, Agile and SCRUM methodologies

Professional Development

Oct 2024 – Jan 2025: Northcoders: This Software Development in JavaScript Skills Bootcamp taught me all the skills I need to become a successful full stack JavaScript Web Developer. I chose this course because it covered both backend and frontend web development. It was an intensive course and we were encouraged to make the most of it by programming in pairs and using our mentors’ knowledge to develop our own expertise. At the end of the course, we created from scratch a team project.

Education

Sep 2018 – Sep 2020: University of Glasgow: I graduated with an MLitt (Distinction) in English Literature.

Sep 2014 – July 2018: University of Edinburgh: I graduated with an MA (First) in German and English Literature. I was awarded a Distinction in spoken German and I also received the class medals for German Language Papers 1 and 2. As part of my degree, I spent a year at the Freie Universität Berlin. I also worked as a part-time English teacher for the Lichtenberger Sprachinstitut.
Employment History

Nov 2023 – Aug 2024: Historic Royal Palaces: As a Warden at the Tower of London, every day I welcomed thousands of visitors to the UK’s most popular tourist attraction. As a guardian of the nation’s Crown Jewels, I took my job very seriously and I really enjoyed my year there. I learned so much about British history and I also worked closely with a large team of colleagues to ensure the safety of all visitors as well as our priceless exhibits.

June 2023 – Oct 2023: Waterstones: As a bookseller at Foyles, my specialty was in children’s bookselling, but I worked across every department and I covered at a number of stores, chiefly Foyles Charing Cross Road and the Foyles branch in Waterloo station. I was always enthusiastic when it came to interacting with customers and I excelled in upselling our book of the month.

January 2023 – June 2023: ATG Entertainment: I was a Customer Experience Team Member at the Harold Pinter Theatre. To prepare for welcoming visitors to A Little Life (a sell-out show with a number of challenging themes), I completed an online course with Mental Health First Aid England. During every performance, I was proactive in dealing with any emergency that might arise, for example if a visitor became very distressed.

October 2021 – Dec 2022: Nimax Theatres: I was an Usher at the Palace Theatre, which is home to Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. During the COVID-19 pandemic, some performances had to be cancelled at the last minute. In situations like this, I empathised with the disappointed visitors and I tried to cheer them up by suggesting alternate Harry Potter-related activities in London.

Aug 2021 – Oct 2021: Nederlander Theatres: My role as a Front of House Assistant at Aldwych Theatre was both extremely enjoyable and occasionally very challenging, because performances of Tina: The Tina Turner Musical often attracted drunk and rowdy audience members. I handled these situations by communicating over the radio with other members of my team and I always remained polite and sought to calm down a visitor who was becoming upset or aggressive.

Jan 2019 – Dec 2019: University of Glasgow: Alongside my part-time postgraduate degree, I also worked as a Student Ambassador. This exciting position involved providing campus tours to prospective students and answering their questions.

Hobbies and Interests

As a student, I wrote and edited for a number of publications, both print (The Herald, The Skinny) and online (DailyArt Magazine, The Student). I have always enjoyed creative writing and one of my stories won first prize in the undergraduate category of a competition run by the Institute of Modern Languages Research and the German Academic Exchange Service. The German-language story was also published in Babble Issue One (pages 38-40): https://llc.ed.ac.uk/delc/delc-creative/babble/issue-one
